# 🌿 My Hobbies Blog

Welcome to my personal space where I share the things that inspire me outside of QA testing — cooking, coffee, and travel. Some of these hobbies also connect with my professional projects, such as testing real-world e-commerce platforms like [Rohlik.cz](https://www.rohlik.cz).

## 🍲 Culinary Blog

I love cooking with seasonal ingredients and discovering new flavors.  
Many of my recipes are based on products I order from [Rohlik.cz](https://www.rohlik.cz), which I also use as a test target in my QA portfolio.

## 🧪 How This Relates to QA

I often apply my testing mindset to everyday tools — such as analyzing e-commerce usability or testing recipes for consistency.  
You can see how I use [Rohlik.cz](https://www.rohlik.cz/en-CZ) both as a customer and a QA tester in my [QA Portfolio](https://github.com/mpleshkova/QA-engineer_Portfolio).
